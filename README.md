# Hand Tracking Projects
Some scripts that are based on a hand tracking algorithm written in Python and OpenCV.

Computer vision became so accessible in our days, that we can build pretty advanced scripts and projects that include AI with just some lines of code.

OpenCV is one of the best examples in the AI field. It's easy to use it and it doesn't require as much hardware as some complex Machine Learning and Deep Learning scripts. 

All scripts are written in Python and are based on the OpenCV library.
